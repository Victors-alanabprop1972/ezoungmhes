Hey, so just got out of The Monkey and honestly, I'm a bit all over the place. My mind's racing like a squirrel on too much caffeine. The theater was 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦zing, felt like I was inside an igloo with a popcorn machine. Speaking of which, popcorn crumbs everywhere, they're like the glitter of snacks—impossible to get rid of, forever embedded in my hoodie. Anyway, the  —

> Right, so the opening scene...wild. Reminded me of that time I got lost in a funhouse mirror maze as a kid. There's this monkey - yeah, the monkey - sitting there, looking like it understood the meaning of life more than I ever will. Or maybe just contemplating its next banana, who knows. My back aching on those uncomfortable chairs was like some kind of medieval torture. Why can't they make them comfortable? Movie studios should collaborate with mattress companies or something.

The soundtrack, man, it was like a mismatched playlist on shuffle but weirdly it worked? That drumbeat felt like it was trying to resuscitate my very soul. Sorry, I know someone, Steve I think, asked if they should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or wait to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it in theaters. Honestly, big screen does it justice, but your call. Image of the main character just staring at the chaos swirling around, like me 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 my houseplants slowly die. And the dialogue, sometimes profound, like fortune cookie wisdom on steroids, other times so out-there I wondered if this was secretly an avant-garde sitcom.

There was this scene—I'm mashed brain—where they zoomed in on the monkey's eyes, and I swear it was like I was looking into the eyes of my old history professor. All knowing and semi-bored. The popcorn guys need better timing. Crunching during the most intense scenes. Why don't theaters offer more silent snacks, like marshmallows or something soft? 

Oh, and don't even get me started on that one sequence with the dance, reminded me of when my cousin tried to perform interpretive dance after two energy drinks at our family BBQ. Either way, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or grab a ticket, just... go in prepared for a rollercoaster of what the hell moments. There's no other way to explain it.
